            <p>
                Love is not a predictable thing. It comes when you least expect it, aphorisms, wisdom, and grandmas tell
                us.
                But we'll try to predict it anyway. Using data Stanford researchers gathered on 3,510 American
                adults, we will explore patterns and trends in how people find love. We will gain insight into when
                people meet
                their romantic partner, how they meet them, and who they are.

                <p>How do couples meet?</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The most popular ways people met their significant others was through their family, friends, and
                coworkers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we look at non-traditional types of couples, we see that this pattern doesn&apos;t necessarily hold.
                Same-sex couples most commonly met online, followed by at a bar or restaurant and through a friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in getting with someone ten years older or younger than you, within legal age
                limits, start looking around at your workplace. Couples with a large age gap were most likely to meet
                through a coworker.

            </p>
            <p>People in interracial relationships were most likely to have met through a friend, then at a bar or
                restaurant and online.
            </p>
            Notably, across all couples the most popular way of meeting a future partner was through family, but
            that&apos;s much
            less likely to be the case for non-traditional couples.

                <p>Which months do couples reach relationship milestones?</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The multi-line graphs visualize the months in which couples typically meet relationship milestones,
                such as when they first met, started dating, moved in together, got married, and separated.
                Separation encompasses couples who are divorced, separated but not divorced, or broken up.
                Each milestone is represented by a color-coded line with points, and you can interact with the graph by
                toggling legend items to emphasize or dim specific milestones. Hovering over a point will show the exact
                count of couples who reached that milestone during a particular month.
                </br>
                </br>
                Interestingly, relationship milestones happen most frequently in the months of June and September.
                Furthermore, the time of milestone completions of nontraditional couples is not significantly different
                from the general trend. You can compare the differences in trends between different types of
                nontraditional couples,
                which can provide insights into how these couples approach their relationships.
                </br>
                </br>
                TLDR:
                <li>There is an jump in every milestone in June. </li>
                <li>Odds of meeting your future partner are the highest in June and September, lowest in the dreary
                    winter months</li>
                <li>Least popular time to tie the knot? January.</li>

                We used the How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017 dataset, which is a study by Stanford University
                researchers of how 3,510 Americans met their spouses and romantic partners. We downloaded the data
                <a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst#download-data">here</a>
                and preprocessed the data separately according to the specific visualization requirements. Since the
                raw data attributes are coded, we used the
                <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vt073cc9067/HCMST_2017_fresh_Codeboodk_v1.1a.pdf">2017
                    Codebook</a>
                and <a
                    href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vt073cc9067/HCMST_2017_fresh_sample_survey_instrument.pdf">
                    Survey Instrument</a> to map each field name
                to the survey question it is representing.
                </br>
                </br>
                For the first visualization of how couples meet, we used Google Sheets for exploratory data analysis
                and processing. There were dedicated columns indicating same-sex and interracial relationships, so we
                filtered by those to get the data for those couples. We added a calculated field to get the age
                differences
                between respondents and their partners, then filtered by age difference of &#62;=10 to get the data for
                large age
                gap couples. Then we honed in on the answers for Q24 in the survey and calculated the percentages of
                respondents
                who responded “yes” to each method of meeting.
                </br>
                </br>
                For the milestone visualization, we imported the raw data to Tableau and generated exploratory data
                visualizations using built-in filtering. To generate data for “All Couples,” for each milestone, we
                filtered
                for respondents that answered a date under Q21A-Q21D, which asks respondents which month and year did
                they meet,
                started a relationship, and various other milestones like moved-in or got married. We did the same
                filtering for
                interracial couples graphs, except that additionally, we also filtered for and counted the number of
                respondents
                that had “yes” under the “Interracial” column (the dataset came with this attribute so no further
                preprocessing
                was needed here). Similarly, for the same-sex graph, we filtered for respondents that answered “yes” to
                the same-sex
                question. For age difference &#62;=6 graph, we added a calculated field in Tableau sheet that filtered
                for respondents
                where the absolute value of their own age and partner&apos;s age is &#62;= 6. However, there are some
                limitations to this
                data visualization. We have excluded cases where respondents did not provide data on when they achieved
                a
                particular milestone, which can skew the results. Additionally, due to the small size of the dataset,
                non-traditional
                couple graphs may not be representative of the broader population, and the trends may not show true
                correlations. Note:
                the y-axes are different across different types of couples due to the varying sample sizes of couples
                types
